As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group’s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate’s net assets. Assumptions were also made for tax and other costs that would be reasonably expected if these assets were to be disposed of.
