It is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortisation of owned property, plant and equipment, software and development to adjusted operating profit. \n\nBy analyzing net debt as a proportion of EBITDA, Swiftnet's financial health can be assessed relative to the size of its earnings. This provides a clearer picture of the company's ability to meet its financial obligations and managing its debtload."}

According to the text, Leigh R. Fox started working for the company in July 2013 as a Chief Administrative Officer. The table provides his age as 47 and his title as President and Chief Executive Officer. Based on this information, we can calculate his tenure with the company by subtracting the start date from the current date.\n\nHowever, the table also lists Andrew R Kaiser, Christi H. Cornette, Thomas E. Simpson, Christopher J. Wilson, Joshua T. Duckworth, and Suzanne E. Maratta. If any of these individuals are currently working for the company, their tenure would need to be considered as well. But based on the text, it implies that they have all left the company as of February 24, 2020.\n\nTherefore, considering only Leigh R. Fox's tenure, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nCurrent date (February 24, 2020) - Start date (July 2013) = 10 years, 3 months, and 20 days.\n\nSo, Leigh Fox's tenure with the company is 10 years, 3 months, and 20 days."}

Services revenue is also comprised of licensing of our Support.com Cloud applications. Services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $4.9 million from 2018. The decrease in service revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the billable hours of our major customers.

As with any market that is undergoing shifts, timing of downward pressures and growth opportunities in our services programs are difficult to predict. We are experiencing downward pressure with some of our services programs as personal computer and certain retail markets are subject to internal re-alignment and other sector specific softness. However, we still see opportunity in the market for growth with our service partners as a result of the evolving support market trends.\nSoftware and other.

Results for fiscal 2019 reflected a 1% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of innovation across multiple brands, which was partially offset by the effects of reduced merchandising spend and the impact of a recall during the fourth quarter. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2018, as continued delivery of top-line accretive innovation in several brands was partially offset by brand building investments with retailers.

Historically,\ndemand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results\nfluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the\nblended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year\nprimarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels\nexceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In\nfiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased\nover prior years.
