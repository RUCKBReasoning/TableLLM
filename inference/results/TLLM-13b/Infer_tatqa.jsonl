This is evident from the table where the total revenues for cloud and license segment in fiscal 2019 were $32,582 million, representing a 2% increase from the previous year. This increase in revenues contributed to the growth in the total margin.\n\nSecondly, there was a slight decrease in the total margin as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This can be explained by the table which shows that the total margin percentage dropped to 66% in fiscal 2019 from 67% in fiscal 2018. This decrease suggests that even though the total margin increased in absolute terms, it was by a smaller margin percentage compared to the previous year.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the text mentions that the total margin increased in fiscal 2019 due to increased revenues. Therefore, the primary reason for the increase in the cloud license segment's total margin in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was the growth in revenues."}

By calculating the net debt to EBITDA ratio, we see how much debt the company has relative to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. \n\nA high net debt to EBITDA ratio indicates that the company has a lot of debt relative to its earnings, which may make it more vulnerable to financial risks. Conversely, a lower net debt to EBITDA ratio suggests that the company has fewer debt compares to its earnings, indicating a more stable financial position.\n\nAnalyzing net debt as a proportion of EBITDA also helps in comparing the financial performance of different companies. By comparing the ratios, we can assess the relative debt and earnings of different companies in the industry. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the market risk and return opportunities."}

For the year ended December 31, 2019, services revenue generated from our partnerships was $56.6 million compared to $61.0 million for 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, direct services revenue was $2.9 million compared to $3.5 million for 2018. As with any market that is undergoing shifts, timing of downward pressures and growth opportunities in our services programs are difficult to predict. We are experiencing downward pressure with some of our services programs as personal computer and certain retail markets are subject to internal re-alignment and other sector specific softness. However, we still see opportunity in the market for growth with our service partners as a result of the evolving support market trends.\nSoftware and other. Software and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees for end-user software products provided through direct customer downloads, and, to a lesser extent, through the sale of these software products via partners. Software and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased compared with the year ended 2018 primarily due to the cancellation of a significant partner contract as well as some softness in new subscriptions and renewals. For the year ended December 31, 2019, direct software and other revenue was $1.9 million compared to $2.8 million for 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, software and other revenue generated from our partnerships was $1.9 million compared to $2.7 million for 2018.\n\n### [Table]\n```\n($ in thousands),2019,% Change 2018 to 2019,2018\r\nServices,\"$59,545\",(8)%,\"$64,476\"\r\nSoftware and other,\"3,788\",(25)%,\"5,073\"\r\nTotal revenue ,\"$63,333\",(9)%,\"$69,549\"\r\n\n```\n\n### [Question]\nWhat are the segments of revenue?\n\n### [Solution]\n", "reference_answer": ["Services", "Software and other"], "assistant_answer": "The segments of revenue are \"Services\" and \"Software and other\"."}

This change is primarily due to the introduction of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, the company's income tax provision reflects discrete net income tax costs of $43 million in 2019, as compared to $180 million in 2018. There was also the reversal of a benefit recorded in 2018 related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, which resulted in a cost of $56 million in 2019. However, these impacts were partially offset by a favorable adjustment of $12 million that was recorded as the company completed its estimates of the potential impacts of the tax act.\n\nIn summary, the change in the statutory federal income tax rate from 2018 to 2019 was a decrease of 10.0%, primarily due to the significant changes in U.S. tax laws introduced by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018."}

{"question": "How is the net average shell egg selling price calculated?", "prompt": "\nOffer a thorough and accurate solution that directly addresses the Question outlined in the [Question].\n### [Table Text]\n\nThe shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant\nloss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the\nperiods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically,\ndemand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results\nfluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the\nblended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year\nprimarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels\nexceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In\nfiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased\nover prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half\nof the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.\n\n### [Table]\n```\nFiscal Year ended,\"June 1, 2019\",\"June 2, 2018\",\"June 3, 2017\"\r\n\"Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. - (in thousands)\",\"$54,229\",\"$125,932\",\"$(74,278)\"\r\nGross profit (in thousands),\"222,859\",\"361,046\",\"45,550\"\r\nNet average shell egg selling price (rounded),1.27,1.40,1.01\r\nAverage Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations 1,1.23,1.49,0.85\r\nFeed cost per dozen produced,0.415,0.394,0.399\r\n\n```\n\n### [Question]\nHow is the net average shell egg selling price calculated?\n\n### [Solution]\n", "reference_answer": ["blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades."], "assistant_answer": "The net average shell egg selling price is calculated by taking the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock, and undergrades.
